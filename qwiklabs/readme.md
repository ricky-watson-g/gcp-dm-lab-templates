# qwikLABS notes


When you are creating templates for qwikLABS deployments please bear in mind the qwikLABS platform:
1. Expects a qwiklabs resource
2. rewrites the .yaml file to insert variables for the project ID, and the account email and password

Examples provided will work as expected and come in jinja and python forms.
